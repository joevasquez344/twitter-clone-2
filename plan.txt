Look into <FlipMove> npm package for animating a post that is just getting placed into the feed for flare


TODO:

- 4 pages tasks listed in page folders

- Dark Mode (exclude)
- @ Feature (exclude)

x Significant Problem (Might need a Model Restructure) **
  if auth user deletes his post that other users have liked,
  the post is not being entirely deleted out of nonAuthUser/likes subcollection (subcollection is being read for its postIds to query posts in /posts collection).
  So when you try to load a non-auth user's liked posts feed, it will throw an error when trying to gain access to the deleted post's uid


x Finish Landing page
- Fix Home page route on app mount after log in/register (seems to hit the / route instead of redirecting to /home)
- Finish hover glow effects on tweets (almost done, need gray glow effects on XIcons within modals, etc.)
x Fix app overflow for clean scrolling with no scroll bars
x Implement sticky headers across the app

x Implement widgets api (Look back at youtube twitter clone course project)
x Implement ability to tweet an image

- Display comments lengths on all Tweet Components across the app
- implement routing to previous route on page header arrows
- Convert DB tweet posted time to Time Ago 
- Implement Bookmark Modal across all pages with Tweet Components

- Media Feed on Profile Page
- Apply ability to post an image on comment modals and comment section of Tweet Details, and don't forget to add the storage
  bucket folder paths to createComment() function in utils/api/comments. Also, imitate the "image selected" design from the TweetBox to 
  comment modals and comment sections
- Redesign to edit profile modal according to twitter
- Implement feature to allow users to add their own avatar and banner to their profile
x Fix pinned tweet display on Profile Page (Clickin unpin the first time doesn't unpin, only when you click a second time does it unpin)
- Implement Search Profile Feature
- Following and Following Page (Issue where "Follows You" badge is displaying when the follower is 
 is following the Profile (non auth user) of Following and Followers but is still displaying even when
  the follower is not following the Auth User) (Follows You badge is only pertaining to the Profile and not 
  the Auth User / )

- Implement Mobile scaling

- Redesign/Update Portfolio (Make sure to add UCI Bootcamp digital certification badges, Github link, Linkdin link, etc.)
- Add Twitter Clone to Portfolio
- Add Netflix Clone to Portfolio
- Add other existing projects to Portfolio if you want

- Update and improve Resume
- Good to go... submit application
