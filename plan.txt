Look into <FlipMove> npm package for animating a post that is just getting placed into the feed for flare


TODO:

x 4 pages' tasks listed in page folders

x Significant Problem (Might need a Model Restructure) **
  if auth user deletes his post that other users have liked,
  the post is not being entirely deleted out of nonAuthUser/likes subcollection (subcollection is being read for its postIds to query posts in /posts collection).
  So when you try to load a non-auth user's liked posts feed, it will throw an error when trying to gain access to the deleted post's uid


x Finish Landing page
x Finish hover glow effects on tweets (almost done, need gray glow effects on XIcons within modals, etc.)
x Fix app overflow for clean scrolling with no scroll bars
x Implement sticky headers across the app

x Implement widgets api (Look back at youtube twitter clone course project)
x Implement ability to tweet an image

x Display comments lengths on all Tweet Components across the app

x Media Feed on Profile Page
x Apply ability to post an image on comment modals and comment section of Tweet Details, and don't forget to add the storage
  bucket folder paths to createComment() function in utils/api/comments. Also, imitate the "image selected" design from the TweetBox to 
  comment modals and comment sections
x Redesign to edit profile modal according to twitter
x Implement feature to allow users to add their own avatar and banner to their profile
x Fix pinned tweet display on Profile Page (Clickin unpin the first time doesn't unpin, only when you click a second time does it unpin)

  x Issue where when you remove a Pinned Post on the Tweets tab, it will appear as a duplicate in the posts state
  x Fix Home page route on app mount after log in/register (seems to hit the / route instead of redirecting to /home)
  x implement routing to previous route on page header arrows
  x implement Delete Banner in Edit Profile Modal
  x Convert DB tweet posted time to Time Ago 
  x Implement Search Profile Feature
  x Place App Search Bar only on the Home Screen
  x Fix issue on Profile Page
  x Fix issue on Tweet Details page in replyToThread. Tweet component useEffect fires when a Tweet's Likes changes, then maps through an incorrect state of Bookmarks,
    within useEffect, leading to the state - isBookmarked - to be incorrect, as well
  x Update UI of More Modals, etc.
  x Update X Icon on Selected Image to Tweet

  x Fix Pinned Tweet padding on Profile Screen
  x Fix unnecessary spacing on Tweet Component below the Name, Username, and Date
  x Fix issues on Comment Modal in Bookmarks Screen where bookmarks won't refresh with updated comment length and issue where the Bookmark Header is still present
    and not shadowed out when Comment Modal is active

  x Add Toolkit component to Tweet Details Post Footer Items
  x Add BookmarkButton in Tweet Details' post footer instead of Submit Icon
  x Fix issue with Likes Modal on Post Details Screen
  x Add Avatar to Tweets
  x Fix issue where after you Edit Your Profile, the pinned post disappears after refetch
  x Fix issue where some Profile Avatars (Victors Profile) on the Tweet Component displays the alt fallback and not DefaultAvatar Component fallback
  x Profile Page Issue - In reducer, split the reused feed state into 4 separate states (Tweets, Tweets and Replies, Media, Likes) so that longer fetches
    don't display in the wrong active feed
  x Home Page and any other page with this issue - When you follow a user by the more dropdown on a Tweet, make sure to update the follow status on   
    all other tweets by that user and not just the tweet that was being interacted with
  x After saving your edited profile, dont refetch the profile. Figure out another way. Currently, after every fetch of a profile, the tabs click count state is
    is reverted back to 0; meaning when a feed tab is clicked, an unnecessary fetch for posts will be invoked
  x Profile Page Issue - Like Post => Pin Post => Unlike Pin Post => Unpin Post - This Tweets liked state is not accurate when following these step-by-step 
    user interactions
  x After a user sign up, the Tweet Box avatar fallback image (DefaultAvatar Component) is not working; the <img /> alt fallback attribute is taking effect
  x When you delete a Tweet, the Tweet component's replyTo display is not showing for the Tweets that are a reply to this deleted post
  x Search Bar - add ability to search/filter for profile's name and not just username
  
  x Implement ability to comment an Image on Tweet Details post
  - Update Loader on Edit Avatar
  - Implement the new component Buttons on each tweet's footer in Bookmarks Screen
  - Handle Edit Profile Banner and Avatar Selected Images that are not valid and display the "alt" attribute value
  x On Profile Screen, when unfollowing the profile via a non-pinned post or profile follow button (top right), the pinned post is not updated based on this interaction

- Implement Mobile scaling

x Redesign/Update Portfolio (Make sure to add UCI Bootcamp digital certification badges, Github link, Linkdin link, etc.)
x Add Twitter Clone to Portfolio
x Add Netflix Clone to Portfolio

- Update and improve Resume
- Good to go... submit application
